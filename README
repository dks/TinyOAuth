With due respect to "OAuth.php" written by John Jawed, it seemed  overcomplica-
ted to me, since to make a simple request you  had  to create  whole  bunch  of 
objects and make lots of method calls. This is  smaller  and simplier implemen-
tation of OAuth protocol.

It is undocumented right now,  has  limited  features  and  is  a  CLIENT  only
library. I'll try to fix this in time, but if you could offer any help I  would
gladly accept it!
